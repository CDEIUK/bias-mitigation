# ML Bias notebooks

This directory contains the raw notebooks use to generate figures for the website and also for generating clean notebooks (with the plots export code removed for clarity) to be accessed through Binder.

Install by navigating to this directory and running

```sh
pip install .
```

The clean notebooks can be found in the `notebooks/` folder in the root of this repository. During the cleaning, any notebook cell that has an `export` tag set will be stripped.
