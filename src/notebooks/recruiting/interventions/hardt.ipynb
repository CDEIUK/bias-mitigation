    "This notebook contains an implementation of the post-processing fairness intervention introduced in [Equality of opportunity in supervised learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3157382.3157469) by Hardt et al. (2016) as part of the IBM AIF360 fairness tool box github.com/IBM/AIF360.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intervention method achieves equalised odds as follows. If only the decisions are available, they randomly choose either the original decision or fixed outcome in a way that ensures agreement across both protected groups. If a score function is available they choose between two carefully chosen thresholds with a particular probability to ensure agreement of true and false positive rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method can be proven to be the optimal postprocessing algorithm for Equalised Odds, however the randomness introduced into decision making - which in particular could mean two identical individuals receive different outcomes - might clash with intuitive notions of fairness."
