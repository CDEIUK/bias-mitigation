# ML Bias site

This directory contains the source code for the website. We use [GatsbyJS][gatsby], a static site generator built on React and JavaScript.

To develop the site you will need to install [NodeJS][node]. With NodeJS installed, you can install site dependencies with

```sh
npm install
```

Start a development server with

```sh
npm start
```

and navigate to `localhost:8000` to see a development build of the site with hot reloading.

Content for the site is in `src/content` in [Mdx][mdx] format, allowing easy editing of the text.
