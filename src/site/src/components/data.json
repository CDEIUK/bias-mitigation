ITL chose to partner with cybersecurity firm Cybernetica, who were able to deploy their Sharemind secure computing platform to enable the analysis to be done whilst protecting confidentiality. 17 companies participated, uploading their metrics to the Sharemind platform, which distributed the data across three “computing parties” (CPs). These CPs performed the desired analysis, using a multi-party computation protocol to ensure confidentiality. The final results of the analysis were shared with the ITL, who disseminated accordingly. The distributed nature of the computation meant no party, including the ITL, ever had direct access to another party’s metrics.",

The weights of the resulting model are periodically communicated back to the central server using a secure aggregation protocol (a form of multi-party computation), which aggregates the weights received from all mobile devices into a new common model. Devices download this new model, and the cycle repeats, such that the model is continuously trained without collecting user data centrally.",

The EU significantly reduced beet subsidies, meaning the country needed to develop a competitive market for trading production rights. A system was developed leveraging multi-party computation to enable confidential bidding to compute a trading price based on supply and demand. This enabled the production quota to be redistributed accordingly, whilst details of individual beet farmers bids remained confidential - 80% of farmers surveyed that this confidentiality was important to them. The first auction took place in 2008, and is considered the first large-scale, practical application of MPC.",

    "description": "The Confidential Consortium Blockchain Framework (CCBF) is a system using trusted execution environments that facilitates confidentiality within a blockchain network. To prevent malicious behaviours, blockchains were designed so that all transactions are recorded and open for all to see and replicated across hundreds of decentralised nodes for integrity. Within CCBF, confidentiality is provided by TEEs that can process transactions encrypted using keys accessible only to a CCBF node of a specific CCBF service. Besides confidentiality, TEEs also provide publicly verifiable artefacts, called quotes, that certify that the TEE is running a specific code. Hence, integrity of transaction evaluation in CCBF can be verified via quotes and not be replicated across mutually untrusted nodes as it is done in public blockchains. It is worth pointing out that transaction data is replicated in CCBF across a small network of nodes, each executing in a TEE, but for the purpose of fault-tolerance rather than integrity. In addition, Microsoft’s test showed that the CCBF could process 50,000+ transactions per second, demonstrating the scalability of the technology. As a comparison, the public blockchain Ethereum network has an average processing rate of 20 transactions per second, whilst the Visa credit card processing system averages 2,000 transactions per second.  The framework is not a standalone blockchain protocol, but rather it provides trusted foundations that can support any existing blockchain protocol.",

The value chosen by the Census Bureau’s Data Stewardship Executive Policy committee was far higher than those envisioned by the creators of differential privacy. There are further challenges, with the National Congress of Native Americans expressing concern that DP could adversely affect the quality of statistics about tribal nations.",
