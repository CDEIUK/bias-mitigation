These health-token based certificates would be created using differential privacy methods, allowing individual test results to be randomised while still allowing for aggregate level estimates of risk to be calculated. The research suggests that health tokens could mitigate discrimination based on immunity and tackle concerns around the creation of an 'immuno-privileged' class. However, it would still offer valuable information on collective transmission risk posed by small groups. ",

The latest report, produced in 2019, includes data for 136,437 employees from 123 organisations, representing 13% of the Greater Boston workforce. The confidentiality provided by the MPC solution has encouraged a greater number of companies to participate in the study, increasing from 69 companies in 2016 to 123 in 2019. User experience was also important in encouraging participation with the user interface providing a familiar spreadsheet that can be filled with data manually or via copy-paste. The statistics derived through this process have shown that the gender pay gap in the Boston area is even larger than previously estimated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",

A system was developed leveraging multi-party computation to enable confidential bidding to compute a trading price based on supply and demand. This enabled the production quota to be redistributed accordingly, whilst details of individual beet farmers bids remained confidential. 80% of farmers surveyed said that this confidentiality was important to them.

These CPs performed the desired analysis using a multi-party computation protocol to ensure confidentiality. The final results of the analysis were shared with the ITL who disseminated accordingly.

The analyst doing the computation only ever saw the outputs of the model. The inputs were encrypted throughout the process. This product has been commercially deployed and can run on real customer data. There have been no data interoperability issues, enabling full use of distributed datasets. ",

    "description": "The Confidential Consortium Blockchain Framework (CCBF) is a system using trusted execution environments that facilitates confidentiality within a blockchain network. Blockchains were designed to provent malicious behaviours by recording all transactions, making them open for all to see and replicated across hundreds of decentralised nodes for integrity. Within CCBF, confidentiality is provided by trusted execution environments (TEEs) that can process transactions that have been encrypted using keys accessible only to a CCBF node of a specific CCBF service. Besides confidentiality, TEEs also provide publicly verifiable artefacts, called quotes, that certify that the TEE is running a specific code. Hence, integrity of transaction evaluation in CCBF can be verified via quotes and not be replicated across mutually untrusted nodes as it is done in public blockchains. It is worth pointing out that transaction data is replicated in CCBF across a small network of nodes, each executing in a TEE, but for the purpose of fault-tolerance rather than integrity. In addition, Microsoft’s test showed that the CCBF could process 50,000+ transactions per second, demonstrating the scalability of the technology. As a comparison, the public blockchain Ethereum network has an average processing rate of 20 transactions per second, whilst the Visa credit card processing system averages 2,000 transactions per second.  The framework is not a standalone blockchain protocol, but rather it provides trusted foundations that can support any existing blockchain protocol.",

The Erasmus MC hospital holds data on the lifestyle of patients, and insurance company Zilverin Kruis holds data on attributes such as hospitalization days and health care usage. The solution consists of two phases. First, a secure inner join protocol is used to identify which patients are present in both datasets. Both parties homomorphically encrypt attributes of the dataset which are sent to a third party, which determines the intersection of the datasets (the third party cannot access the raw data directly, since it's homomorphically encrypted). The encrypted intersection is split into 3 secret shares, which are split across the 3 parties, and an MPC protocol is used to train a regression model. Erasmus MC and Zilverin Krius receive the coefficients of the regression, which they can then use to predict the risk of individual patients.",

The code is executed in the datacenter, with the data kept in situ - data is never moved from where it was originally kept. Researchers are thus unable to download data, mitigating a key risk. The platform provides researchers with dummy data (NOT synthetic data) to develop their code. Once developed, the code must pass a series of automated sanity checks before it is packaged and deployed to the EHR provider's datacenter to execute the analysis.

Signal leverages novel security technologies in order to provide features expected by users without collecting data about them. One such example is their use of trusted execution environments (TEEs) - namely, Intel SGX - to allow contact information from a user's phone to be used to find their contacts who are also on Signal. A server-side contact discovery service runs inside the TEE, to which a user uploads their contact information, the service looks for matches in Signal's database of registered users, and information of these matches is returned to the user. Contact information is only decrypted inside the isolated TEE, meaning Signal has no visibility of it. Additionally, SGX supports remote attestation, meaning the client is able to verify that it is the expected contact discovery service code running inside the TEE before using it.",
