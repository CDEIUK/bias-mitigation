Before we do any modelling, we should think about what we are trying to achieve and identify possible bias-related risks, as well as whether the data we have available to us is appropriate for the task.

## Purpose identification

Our goal is to try and predict whether an individual should receive a job offer based on their experience, qualifications and demographics. We will do so by training a model on historical job applicants to predict whether they received an offer or not. We assume that the historical decisions will contain biases against certain groups that we do not wish to perpetuate. Moreover, many of the features such as the individual's qualifications will reflect systemic biases which could negatively influence our decision making. We expect our model will be vulnerable to discrimination both by race and sex.

## Data identification

We generate a synthetic data set of historical applicants. The full details of our data generation can be seen in [this notebook][binder-data].

<Collapse label="Features in the synthetic data">

The synthetic data we generate contains the following features, which we chose by drawing on real-life hiring data.

- `sex_male`: the sex of the applicant,
- `race_white`: the race of the applicant,
- `years_experience`: the number of years of relevant work experience the applicant has,
- `referred`: whether the applicant was referred for the position or not,
- `gcse`: number of GCSEs,
- `a_level`: number of A-level qualifications,
- `russell_group`: whether the applicant attended a Russell Group university,
- `honours`: whether the applicant graduated with honours,
- `years_volunteer`: number of years of volunteering experience,
- `income`: the applicant's current income,
- `it_skills`: the applicant's IT skill,
- `years_gaps`: number of years of gaps in the applicant's CV,
- `quality_cv`: quality of the written CV,

In addition to this, the binary label `employed_yes` encodes whether the applicant was employed or not.

Since we have generated the data, we have ensured that we only generated relevant features to the task of predicting whether an applicant was employed or not. Moreover we have ensured that the data is balanced across the protected groups, i.e. the data is evenly split between male and female, and white and non-white applicants. Of course in general this won't be true, but ensuring different protected groups are well represented is often an easy way to reduce bias, and hence if the data were not balanced we should investigate whether it's possible to collect more data.

Once the data has been preprocessed, we can look at bias that is present in the data, before we have even trained a model. First, we look at the proportion of male and female applicants employed, we see that the proportion is much higher for men.

Similarly, there is a large disparity in proportion of successful applicants across different races.

Finally, we identify a possible "legitimate risk factor" in the `years_experience` feature. There is a clear relationship between the number of years of experience and the chances that the applicant is successful, which seems intuitively reasonable. Of course we should be careful, because the years of experience accumulated by any one applicant is itself influenced by societal factors. For example, women often take time out of their careers to raise children, and hence might have less experience if measured only in years in work.

Next we'll try training a model without any attempt to mitigate bias and investigate the results.
