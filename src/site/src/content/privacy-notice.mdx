cdeiuk.github.io is maintained by the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI).

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is the data controller for pages starting with [cdeiuk.github.io][cdeiuk-gh-pages] - for example, [cdeiuk.github.io/bias-mitigation][bias-mitigation].

If you follow a link to a service provided by another government department, agency or local authority, that organisation will:

- be the data controller
- be responsible for processing any data you share with them
- publish and manage their own privacy notice with details of how to contact them

A data controller determines how and why personal data is processed.

We do not store your personal information through Google Analytics (for example your name or address).

We continuously test and monitor our data protection controls to make sure they’re effective and to detect any weaknesses.
