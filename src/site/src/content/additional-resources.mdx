The [Fairlearn User Guide][fairlearn-user-guide] not only gives an overview of the functionality of the library, but also contains a high-level overview of fairness in machine learning.

Similarly, the [AI Fairness 360 Resources][aif360-resources] contain worked examples and discussion of concepts from fairness in machine learning.

Google published an [interactive visualisation][hardt-dashboard] that serves as a companion to [Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning][hardt-paper] by Hardt et al. It explains a few different notions of fairness and the tension between them.
