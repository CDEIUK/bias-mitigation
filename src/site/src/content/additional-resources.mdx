The <OutboundLink href="https://fairlearn.github.io/user_guide/index.html">Fairlearn User Guide</OutboundLink> not only gives an overview of the functionality of the library, but also contains a high-level overview of fairness in machine learning.

Similarly, the <OutboundLink href="https://aif360.mybluemix.net/resources#overview">AI Fairness 360 Resources</OutboundLink> contain worked examples and discussion of concepts from fairness in machine learning.

Google published an <OutboundLink href="https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/">interactive visualisation</OutboundLink> that serves as a companion to <OutboundLink href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6374-equality-of-opportunity-in-supervised-learning.pdf">Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning</OutboundLink> by Hardt et al. It explains a few different notions of fairness and the tension between them.
