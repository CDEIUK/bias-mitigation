The <OutboundLink href="https://fairlearn.github.io/user_guide/index.html">Fairlearn User Guide</OutboundLink> not only gives an overview of the functionality of the library, but also contains a high-level overview of fairness in machine learning.

Similarly, the [AI Fairness 360 Resources][aif360-resources] contain worked examples and discussion of concepts from fairness in machine learning.

Google published an [interactive visualisation][hardt-dashboard] that serves as a companion to [Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning][hardt-paper] by Hardt et al. It explains a few different notions of fairness and the tension between them.

## Our code

All of the code for our experiments and this site are available on [GitHub][github]. You can run any of the notebooks we used to clean data or train models directly in your browser on [Binder][binder].
