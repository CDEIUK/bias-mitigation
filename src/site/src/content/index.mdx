This website is a companion to the CDEI's review of bias in decision making algorithms. As part of that report we reviewed the academic literature and current best practices in industry to propose some best practice recommendations for mitigating unfairness.

We here present the results of experimentation with a number of interventions from the academic literature on two data sets, one representing an application in finance, the other in recruiting.

## Finance

We train fair models on the well known [Adult data set][adult-data] from the UCI machine learning repository. Click [here](finance/intro) for more details including an overview of the data.

## Recruiting

For the recruiting application we train models on a synthetic data set of job applicants. Click [here](recruiting/intro) for more details, including an overview of the data generation process.
