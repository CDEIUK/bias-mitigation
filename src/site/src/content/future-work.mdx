## Use Case Repository and Adoption Guide

The [Use Case Repository](/repository) is a living document which we aim to to supplement with further interesting use cases going forward. We hope this will prove a useful resource for organisations seeking to leverage PETs, and enable them to learn from others in the community. We are eager to engage with organisations that would like to contribute to the repository.

Additionally, we would welcome feedback from those making use of the [Adoption Guide](/adoption-guide), as we wish to make this as useful as possible to organisations.

In either case, please do reach out to [pets@cdei.gov.uk][pets-email]
