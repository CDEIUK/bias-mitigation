## Use Case Repository

The [Use Case Repository](/repository) is a living document which we aim to to supplement with further interesting use cases going forward. We hope this will prove a useful resource for organisations seeking to leverage these technologies, and enable them to learn from others in the community.

If you are interested in contributing to the repository please contact [pets@cdei.gov.uk][pets-email]

## PETs Adoption Guide

We are developing a _**PETs Adoption Guide**_ to assist individuals and organisations working on data initiatives in considering how they might use PETs in their projects.

The Guide will be hosted on this site.

## PETs and data protection

Using PETs may help data controllers and processors meet their obligations under the Data Protection Act, and adhere to the principles of the GDPR. However, some PETs facilitate novel data processing paradigms, and there may be uncertainty around how the GDPR should be applied in these circumstances. There may be particular challenges for sectors such as finance, where the DPA must be considered alongside financial regulations set out by the Financial Conduct Authority.

CDEI will collaborate with public sector organisations and private sector industry to address these challenges, so that organisations are empowered to leverage these technologies to drive trustworthy data-driven innovation.
