## Use Case Repository

The [Use Case Repository](/repository) is a living document which we aim to to supplement with further interesting use cases going forward. We hope this will prove a useful resource for organisations seeking to leverage PETs, and enable them to learn from others in the community.

If you are interested in contributing to the repository please contact [pets@cdei.gov.uk][pets-email]

## PETs Adoption Guide

We are developing a _**PETs Adoption Guide**_ to assist individuals and organisations working on data initiatives in considering how they might use PETs in their projects.

The Guide will be hosted on this site.

## Ethics, policy and regulation

PETs may help data controllers and processors to meet their obligations under the Data Protection Act, and adhere to the principles of the GDPR. However, PETs can facilitate novel data processing paradigms in which there may be uncertainty over how the data protection law should be interpreted and applied.

Additionally, PETs may not necessarily always be a force for good. It is a very narrow definition of privacy that is enabled by these technologies, and it is possible that PETs could enable harmful uses of data that were previously not possible.

We are carrying out research that aims to address some of these challenges, asking the following research questions:

- What are the barriers inhibiting more widespread adoption of PETs in both the public and private sectors?
- How does the use of PETs affect compliance with data protection regulation? Are there regulatory ambiguities that require clarification?
- In what ways could PETs be used for harm? How can we mitigate those?
- Where PETs are used beneficially, how can this be effectively communicated to build consumer confidence and public trust?

We hope to support other organisations in the public and private sectors in tackling these issues.

## TODO: do we need an acknowledgements page??
