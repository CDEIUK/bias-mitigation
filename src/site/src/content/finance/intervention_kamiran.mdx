title: Fairness mitigation via label modification post-processing by Kamiran et al. (2012)
order: 4

import { LazyPlot } from "../../components/myplotly"

Here we give details on the fairness intervention by Kamiran et al. (2012) which relabels data points for which the model prediction is not decisive. Such data points are assigned the positive label if they belong to the unprivileged group and the negative label otherwise.

As the intervention happens post-processing, we start by training a model on the data where we solely optimise for performance, but not for fairness. The model is a shallow, feed-forward neural network, see **ADD NOTEBOOK LINK** for details.
