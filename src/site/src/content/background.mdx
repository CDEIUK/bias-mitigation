## Background
** Pull in stuff from landscape?
** Rationale for the work - reference CDEI's data sharing paper, Royal Society report

### What are PETs?
** Distinguish between traditional techniques and emerging PETs
** Highlight that PETs fit within a broader privacy ecosystem, and reference other techniques such as audit trails, access controls, organisational governance structures etc.
** Mention subcategories of PETs i.e. PSI, ZKP, private information retrieval

Other stuff from the landscape? Take a look

### Other work in this are
** ICO
** FCA
** Royal Society
