## Using the guide

- The guide is primarily aimed at technical architects and product owners working on projects that involve the sharing or processing of sensitive information.
- Answer the questions that appear in the decision tree by clicking on the node containing the appropriate answer. Do this recursively until you reach an end node which can be clicked to display further information.
- You can also explore the whole decision tree structure by clicking to expand the various different nodes in the tree.

## Key considerations

**TODO: Here are some considerations that were taken into account when developing the adoption guide**
