Welcome to the [Centre for Data Ethics & Innovationâ€™s (CDEI)][cdei-gov-dot-uk] privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) website. We are an independent body advising the UK government on the opportunities and ethical challenges of using data-driven technologies.

We have been researching the role of PETs in enabling safe, private and trustworthy use of data. We believe these emerging technologies have the potential to be disruptive in enabling valuable data sharing and analysis whilst protecting privacy and confidentiality. For this potential to be fully realised, we need an environment that encourages and facilitates appropriate adoption of these technologies. To contribute to this, we have been investigating uses of PETs across a range of sectors. By collating examples and conducting in-depth case studies, we hope to draw out common learnings and identify areas where more widespread use of PETs could have significant impact in unlocking innovative data sharing and processing, and enhancing the security and privacy of existing data-driven systems.

On this site you will find:

- A [PETs Adoption Guide](/adoption-guide) to aid decision-makers in thinking through which PETs may be useful in their projects
- A [repository of real world use cases](/repository) collated from our research so far
- A [glossary](/glossary) defining the different PETs that our research has focused on
- A catalogue of [additional resources](/additional-resources) for further reading
- An [explanation of our future work](/future-work) in this area

We start by providing some [background](/background) to the work.

This site is a work in progress, and we welcome any questions, comments and feedback you may have. Please do get in touch by emailing [pets@cdei.gov.uk][pets-email]
