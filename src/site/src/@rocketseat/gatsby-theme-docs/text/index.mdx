Welcome to the [Centre for Data Ethics & Innovationâ€™s (CDEI)][cdei-gov-dot-uk] Privacy-Enhancing Technology site. We are an independent body advising the UK government on the opportunities and ethical challenges in data-driven technologies.

We have been researching the role of PETs in enabling safe, private and trustworthy use of data. We believe these emerging technologies have the potential to be disruptive in enabling valuable data sharing and analysis whilst protecting privacy and confidentiality. For this potential to be fully realised, we need an environment that encourages and facilitates adoption of these technologies. To contribute to this, we have been investigating current uses of PETs across a range of sectors. By collating examples and conducting in-depth case studies, we hope to draw out common learnings and identify areas where more widespread use of PETs will have significant impact in maintaining privacy and security of sensitive data.

On this site you will find:

- A [repository of use cases](/repository) collated in our research so far
- A [glossary](/glossary) defining the emerging PETs that our research is focussed on
- An [explanation of our future work](/future-work) in this area and key research questions

We hope you find this site useful in building your awareness and understanding of PETs. We also hope you are able to use it in your own research and deployment of these technologies. If you have questions, feedback or would like to learn more about our research, please contact [pets@cdei.gov.uk][pets-email]
