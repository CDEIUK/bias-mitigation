In this series of posts we are going to use the Adult data set from the [UCI Machine learning repository][adult-data] to demonstrate how bias in machine learning can be measured and mitigated.

The Adult data set is derived from the 1994 US census. It contains a number of demographic features such as sex, race, marital status, hours worked per week and age. The task is to predict whether the individual earns more than $50,000 per year or not.

For the purpose of this demonstration, we are going to assume that we are a credit card company that wants market a new premium credit card for high-earners. We want to build a model that can identify likely high-earning individuals based on their demographics so that we can effectively target our marketing.

We will use this hypothetical application to walk through the steps of our recommended workflow, and discuss the considerations that should be made at each step. We will start with a discussion of the problem and whether the data we have available to us for the task is appropriate. We will go on to train a model without intervention to examine the resulting bias. After understanding the consequences of not trying to mitigate bias, we will go on to compare a number of possible interventions. Where possible we use open-source tools, though in a few cases we implement simple versions of the algorithms presented in the accompanying report. Finally we'll finish by
