The core problem appears to be that the tension between performance and fairness constraints leads to some instability during training that is typical of adversarial methods. Zhang et al. recommend a few possible strategies for addressing these problems, such as modifying the discriminator loss weight over time so as to slowly increase the penalty for unfairness. In our implementation we warm up without a fairness constraint, but then turn on the fairness constraint suddenly rather than slowly increase it, so there are things we could have done differently to address some of the training issues, however it's clear that imposing equalised odds with this algorithm is more delicate than other definitions of fairness.\"), mdx(LazyPlot, _extends({}, eo, {\n    mdxType: \"LazyPlot\"\n  })));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","frontmatter":{"title":"Mitigating Unwanted Biases with Adversarial Learning"},"fields":{"collection":"finance"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/finance/adversarial-mitigation/","next":null,"previous":{"fields":{"collection":"finance","slug":"/finance/biased-model/"},"frontmatter":{"order":3,"title":"Training a biased model"}}}}}
